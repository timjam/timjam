- Full stack dev with occasional side quests to some other areas in IT
- Here's a non-comprehensive list of techs and buzzwords I mostly work with:
  - React, React Native, Tailwind, Typescript, NodeJS, Express, Redux, Zod, Docker, AWS, Jest,
- Less often, but still sometimes I do something with:
  -  AI, Machine vision, Matlab, Python, Swift
-  Continuously trying to learn something new on all those listed and other things too
-  Currently Github only contains my random hobby projects, which are probably never going to be finished
-  I dare to ask (stupid) questions, so bare with me
